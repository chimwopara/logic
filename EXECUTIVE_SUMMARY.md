## 🎮 HOW IT WORKS

### Line Usage
```
User starts challenge → Views hint (1 line)
                     ↓
Clicks correct code (1 line) → Move to next step
                     ↓
Total for 50 steps: 100 lines (best case)
```

**Lines charged only when interacted with:**
- Best case: 2 lines/step (hint + correct answer)
- Average: 3-4 lines/step
- Worst case: 6 lines/step (viewed everything)

### Line Earning
```
You create a challenge with 50 steps (avg)
Someone solves it using 150 lines
        ↓
You earn +150 lines! 💰
        ↓
100 people solve it = +15,000 lines
        ↓
That's 15 months of Free tier value!
```

### Monthly Reset
```
Nov 15: New user signs up → 1000 lines (counting down)
Dec 1: First reset → +1000 lines added to remaining
        ↓
If user had 400 left: 400 + 1000 = 1400 total
        ↓
Lines accumulate month over month!
```

## 🔗 SHARING SYSTEM

### Serial Numbers
Every challenge gets a unique 6-character serial:
```
Challenge created → Assigned serial "a3k9m2"
                  ↓
Shareable URL: promptsandlogic.com/a3k9m2
                  ↓
Anyone with link can play it
                  ↓
Creator earns lines from every solve!
```

### Auto-Complete
```
User types: "reverse a string in python"
          ↓
System searches existing challenges
          ↓
Found 3 similar challenges
          ↓
User chooses:
- Use existing (0 compute cost, creator earns)
- Create new (AI generation, adds to store)
```

## 📈 GROWTH STRATEGY

### Viral Mechanics
1. **Share incentive**: Earn lines when others use your challenges
2. **Serial URLs**: Easy to share on social media
3. **Daily challenges**: Bring users back every day
4. **Leaderboards**: Competitive motivation
5. **Friends league**: Invite friends to compete

### Conversion Funnel
```
Free user creates challenges
        ↓
Challenges get popular (used 100+ times)
        ↓
User earns lots of lines
        ↓
User now has buffer of extra lines
        ↓
User creates more → uses more lines
        ↓
Eventually exceeds 1,000/month
        ↓
Upgrades to Boost tier!
```
